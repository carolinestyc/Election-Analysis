# Election-Analysis
### Challenge 3

## Project Overview
Tom and Seth with the Colorado Board of Elections have requested assistance with the election audit for a local Congressional race. They want to use Python to verify the results and ask that I share the information in a terminal output and a txt file. There are five (5) initial points of information needed for the audit:
1. Total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.
### Challenge Overview
After the initial analysis was shared with the Election Commission, they requested some additional information regarding the counties. There are three (3) additional points of information requested:
1. The voter turnout for each county.
2. The percentage of votes from each county of the total count.
3. The county with the highest turnout.

This information will then be shared with Seth & Tom to communicate appropriately to the Elections Commission.
